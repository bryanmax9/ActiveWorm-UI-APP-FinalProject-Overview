Ｂｅａｃｈ Ｆｉｎｄｅｒ

Hi everyone!, During this time I have been doing large projects, however, github does not allow publishing large projects.
Therefore I invite you to enter my linktree to see the projects made so far: https://linktr.ee/bryanmax9 

Today I have finished a part of my final project that I plan to create after finishing studying React Native.
Beach Finder is a page that I plan to create which has the purpose of meeting people in your area.
However, that is not all, this social network WILL NOT HAVE THE POSSIBILITY TO POST IMAGES OR VIDEOS.
Now they will ask themselves, and why this functionality could not be used? this is because today people rely a lot on the physical part of people when it comes to meeting new people, this is seen in many social networks where people meet.
Some examples are Instagram, TikTok, Hinge, OKCupid, Tinder, Bumble. So this is a dating social network? reddit is not a dating app but many found their soulmates there.
Any social media are dating apps by itself. The website is inspired by facebook and reddit, the combination of these two platforms.
However, unlike these platforms, this web page with the push of a button will join you in chat with a random person. Because it will bind you to a person you don't know, to prevent any danger to the user I'm thinking of adding strong authentication for all users.
I am thinking of asking for some real identification of the user, this in order to prevent cases of kidnapping and even to prevent someone of legal age from interacting with a minor.
Users who do not authenticate will not be able to chat. Due to many cases of kidnapping and even abuse in networks like Tinder or Bumble, the identification will help users to report the person and thus punish him effectively with the authorities.

Thanks for reading about The final Project im going to make.
